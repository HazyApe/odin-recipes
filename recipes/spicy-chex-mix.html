    <h1>Spicy Chex Mix</h1>
    <p>Most of us will be sitting at home next weekend passing out candy to little goblins and ghouls, so I thought you might need a little spicy-salty-crunchy snack to keep you company as you wait for that doorbell to ring. 
        This Spicy Chex Mix is the classic snack mix but with a spicy kick! It’s super easy to make and the cost is just so much less to make at home compared to buying it pre-packaged. 
        You might find yourself making a batch every week or so instead of buying your regular chips and pretzels!</p>
