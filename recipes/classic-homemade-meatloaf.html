    <h1>Classic Homemade Meatloaf</h1>

    <p>The concept of meatloaf kind of makes me raise an eyebrow because, well, it’s a loaf of meat. 
        But when it’s executed well it’s just so good. So filling, so cozy, and so delicious that I look forward to eating the leftovers over the next few days (hello meatloaf sandwich, I’m looking at you). 
        This Classic Homemade Meatloaf recipe is the traditional meatloaf that we all know and love—tender, juicy, full of flavor, and with the perfectly tangy tomato glaze on top. 
        It’s so perfect when paired with mashed potatoes and green beans. Like a plate of pure comfort!</p>
